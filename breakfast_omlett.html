        <li>    1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>    2 bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>    8 oz. button mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>    Kosher salt</li>
        <li>    Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>    1/2 lb. sirloin steak, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>    6 large eggs</li>
        <li>    3 tbsp. milk</li>
        <li>    1 c. shredded provolone</li>
        <li>    1 tbsp. butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>    In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add onions, peppers, and mushrooms and    season with salt and pepper, then cook until softened, about 10 minutes. <br><br>
        </li>

        <li>    Move veggies to one side of skillet and heat remaining tablespoon oil. Add steak to empty side of skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook until undersides develop a crust, about 2 minutes, then flip steak and cook 1 minute more for medium. Stir steak together with vegetables, then transfer to a plate.<br><br>
        </li>

        <li>    Make omelet: In the same skillet over medium heat, melt butter. In a small bowl, beat eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper, then pour half the egg mixture into skillet.<br><br>
        </li>

        <li>   Cook until eggs begin to set around edges, about 30 seconds, then use a spatula to gently lift around edges, allowing uncooked egg to flow to center. Once set, add a layer of provolone to one side of omelet, then top cheese with half the steak mixture. Top with another layer of provolone, then cover skillet with a lid and cook until melted, 1 minute. Use spatula to flip untopped side over to cover. Repeat with remaining ingredients for second omelet.<br><br>
